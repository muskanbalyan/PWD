        History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning "inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation") 
    is the study of the past. Events occurring before the invention of writing systems are considered 
    prehistory. "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, 
    collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Historians 
    place the past in context using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, ecological markers,
     and material objects including art and artifacts.

    History also includes the academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze a 
    sequence of past events, and investigate the patterns of cause and effect that are related to them. Historians seek
     to understand and represent the past through narratives. They often debate which narrative best explains an event,
      as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians also debate the nature of history and its 
      usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing "perspective" on
       the problems of the present.
    
    Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), 
    are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends. History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence. However,
     ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and 
     continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study 
     of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is often taught as part of primary and secondary
      education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies.
    
    Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered (within the Western tradition) to be the "father of history", 
    or, the "father of lies". Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of human
     history. Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused 
     Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing. In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring 
     and Autumn Annals, was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived.

    Etymology
    <hr style="width:70%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
</font> </center><p>
    The word history comes from the Ancient Greek ἱστορία (historía), meaning "inquiry",
     "knowledge from inquiry", or "judge". It was in that sense that Aristotle used the 
     word in his History of Animals. The ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns,
      Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath, and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either 
      "judge" or "witness", or similar). The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia,
       meaning "investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, 
       writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative". 
       History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old Welsh) into Old English as stær
        ("history, narrative, story"), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period.
         Meanwhile, as Latin became Old French (and Anglo-Norman), historia developed into forms such 
         as istorie, estoire, and historie, with new developments in the meaning: "account of the events
          of a person's life (beginning of the 12th century), chronicle, account of events as relevant 
          to a group of people or people in general (1155), dramatic or pictorial representation of
           historical events (c. 1240), body of knowledge relative to human evolution, science (c. 1265), 
           narrative of real or imaginary events, story (c. 1462)".

    It was from Anglo-Norman that history was borrowed into Middle English, and this time the loan stuck.
     It appears in the 13th-century Ancrene Wisse, but seems to have become a common word in the late 14th century,
      with an early attestation appearing in John Gower's Confessio Amantis of the 1390s (VI.1383):
       "I finde in a bok compiled | To this matiere an old histoire, | The which comth nou to mi memoire". 
       In Middle English, the meaning of history was "story" in general. The restriction to the meaning
        "the branch of knowledge that deals with past events; the formal record or study of past events, 
        esp. human affairs" arose in the mid-15th century. With the Renaissance, older senses of the word
         were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late 16th century,
          when he wrote about natural history. For him, historia was "the knowledge of objects determined by space
           and time", that sort of knowledge provided by memory (while science was provided by reason, and poetry 
           was provided by fantasy).<br><br>
    In an expression of the linguistic synthetic vs. analytic/isolating dichotomy, English like Chinese (史 vs. 诌) 
    now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general. In modern German, French, and most
     Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used 
     to mean both "history" and "story". Historian in the sense of a "researcher of history" is attested from 1531.
      In all European languages, the substantive history is still used to mean both "what happened with men", and 
      "the scholarly study of the happened", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, or the 
      word historiography. <br>

Description
</font> <br><p></u>
    Historians write in the context of their own time, and with due
     regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past,
      and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society. 
      In the words of Benedetto Croce, "All history is contemporary
       history". History is facilitated by the formation of a
        "true discourse of past" through the production of narrative
         and analysis of past events relating to the human race.
          The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional
           production of this discourse.

 History and Pre history
    <hr style="width:65%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
</font> </center><p>
    The history of the world is the memory of the past experience of Homo sapiens
     sapiens around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in
      written records. By "prehistory", historians mean the recovery of knowledge
       of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing 
       of a culture is not understood. By studying painting, drawings, carvings, 
       and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence
        of a written record. Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is 
        considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations,
         such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian America. Historians in the 
         West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the Western world.
          In 1961, British historian E. H. Carr wrote:<br><br>
          The line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when 
          people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both
           in their past and in their future. History begins with the handing down of tradition;
            and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future.
             Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.

    Historiography 
    <hr style="width:100%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
</font> </center><p>
    Historiography has a number of related meanings. Firstly,
     it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the
      development of methodology and practices (for example, the move 
      from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic
       analysis). Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific
        body of historical writing (for example, "medieval historiography during 
        the 1960s" means "Works of medieval history written during the 1960s").
         Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the philosophy of history.
          As a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception
           can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives,
            interpretations, world view, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians.
             Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single 
             coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.<br><br>
